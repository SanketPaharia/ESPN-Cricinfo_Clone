        content:`<p>Mayank Agarwal, who had a disappointing run in IPL 2022 with the bat while leading Punjab Kings, has been working on trying to turn his white-ball game around by "opening up four-five areas".</p>
        <p>Agarwal tallied just 196 runs in 12 innings for Kings in IPL 2022, averaging 16.33 and striking at 122.50 - he was not even among the top five scorers for his side in the competition. But now, at the Maharaja T20 Trophy - the local T20 tournament in Karnataka - he has struck 480 runs in 11 innings at an average of 53.33 and strike rate of 167.24, with two centuries, for Bengaluru Blasters.</p>
        <p>"In the last four months, I've really worked hard on my batting. As you can see, I've started sweeping and reverse-sweeping the ball, that too against the fast bowlers," Agarwal told ESPNcricinfo. "I've opened up four-five areas in my game which are paying rich dividends. I am very happy that the hard work I put in is paying off now.</p>
        <p>"Getting two hundreds in a T20 tournament like the Maharaja Trophy feels amazing. It feels really nice when the players respond to you the way you want. Obviously runs behind my back really makes me feel good and then I can lead from the front."</p>
        <p>In the 287 balls he has faced in the Maharaja T20 Trophy, Agarwal has hit as many as 50 fours and 20 sixes and brought up centuries off 48 balls against K Gowtham's Shivamogga Strikers and off 58 balls against Gulbarga Mystics led by Manish Pandey. The last win put Blasters in the final.</p>
        <p>At a time when the surfeit of international cricket is forcing India's team management, and selectors, to broaden the pool of players to never-before proportions, Agarwal has been conspicuous by his absence. He has played 21 Tests and five ODIs [but no T20Is] over the years, but the last of them came back in March against Sri Lanka in Bengaluru. He wasn't picked in the original squad for the fifth Test at Edgbaston in July, but flew across as cover for KL Rahul, who was injured, and Rohit Sharma, who had tested positive for Covid-19. He didn't play the Test, though, because India decided to open with Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara.</p>
        <p>"I am somebody who isn't going to give up," Agarwal said about his international future. "I am going to keep chasing it and improve my game with each passing day. I will be very happy with whatever comes my way, but the aspirations and dreams never die.</p>
        <p>"It's about going out there, improving and ticking all those boxes."</p>`,

Fellow Pakistani Fakhar Zaman is the other having played one game for Brisbane Heat in the 2021-22 edition.</p>
        <p>Hasnain had his bowling action reported during last year's competition but has since been cleared to resume bowling.</p>

        <p>Taylor, who is now retired from international cricket, could be an interesting option if a team is looking for an experienced batter as he does not have any conflicting deals at the moment.</p>
        <p>Smeed is the highly-rated young English batter who has a strike-rate of 146.23 from 52 T20 matches and he recently became the first player to hit a century in the men's Hundred. He has already gained global interest and has an ILT20 deal with MI Emirates in January.</p>
        <p>Off the 332 players lined up for the draft, 28 are eligible for retention by clubs they played for last season. The first 12 players are part of the platinum list, which was announced on Monday, with the rest following in gold, silver and bronze categories.</p>

        <p>Australia face Zimbabwe in three ODIs in Townsville from Sunday, before they meet world No.1 New Zealand for three matches in Cairns from September 6.</p>
        <p>Sunday's match marks the first time in almost two years Australia has played a home ODI and will be Zimbabwe's first bilateral series here since the 2003-2004 summer.</p>
        <p>Carey says with the World Cup just 12 months away and the squad at almost full strength, it's time to begin preparations.</p>
        <p>"We see it as a great opportunity to continue to evolve our one-day cricket to get some form leading into the next 12 months. So it is a good way to start," he told reporters in Townsville. "Most players will know their roles coming into the series.</p>
        <p>"Players have been playing the last couple of weeks as well over in the Hundred in England, so for us it's preparing the best way we can.</p>
        <p>"One-day cricket you know how you try to set up, but we'll obviously sum up the conditions as well and play accordingly."</p>
        <p>Zimbabwe named their 15-man squad for the tour on Tuesday after falling 3-0 to India in a series at home. With Craig Ervine still sidelined due to a hamstring injury, Regis Chakabva will captain the side again.</p>
        <p>Their recent series against India and Bangladesh will provide important footage Carey said, with little known of some of their squad.</p>
        <p>"In this format, I haven't played them," he said. "They've had some recent form so they'll be keen to come over here and play some good cricket. They knocked off Bangladesh recently. So we will do our research if guys haven't already started.</p>

        content:`<p>Kane Richardson struck twice in as many balls to seal a crucial Birmingham Phoenix success as they overcame Oval Invincibles by 10 runs to climb to third in the men's Hundred table.</p>
        <p>Richardson, who removed Jordan Cox and Invincibles captain Sam Billings with successive deliveries, finished with three for 22 at the Kia Oval, while fellow seamer Tom Helm claimed an impressive three for 11.</p>
        <p>Those performances underpinned the Phoenix victory despite the best efforts of the Curran brothers, with both Sam and Tom clattering a flurry of sixes but their side fell short on 156 for eight.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Liam Livingstone (45 from 32) and Moeen Ali (42 from 25) led the way as the visitors posted 166 for six, with their bowlers ensuring that proved to be a winning total.</p>
        <p>Having endured a lean run in three innings since his unbeaten century against Southern Brave, big-hitting opener Will Smeed appeared to be back on track after Phoenix were put in.</p>
        <p>Smeed thrashed 23 from the first 13 deliveries of the innings, including two sixes, but was undone when he misjudged a pull off Mohammad Hasnain and Sam Curran back-pedalled at mid-on to clasp the catch.</p>
        <p>Moeen took over the baton with relish, compiling a 25-ball knock that contained four cleanly-struck maximums, including one off Sunil Narine, who bowled tightly overall to finish with two for 21.</p>
        <p>Narine had the last word, persuading the Phoenix skipper to hole out following his 69-run stand with Livingstone - who began in sedate fashion before bursting into destructive mode against Sam Curran.</p>
        <p>Livingstone dispatched the left-armer over the leg-side boundary three times in four deliveries, but he missed out on a second half-century of the tournament, skying Matt Milnes (three for 32) into the hands of long-on.</p>
        <p>The Invincibles suffered a swift double blow as they slid to 11 for two in reply, with Will Jacks trapped lbw by Richardson - and using up a review in the process - before Rilee Roussouw perished to Smeed's superbly-judged diving catch on the leg side.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the out of form Jason Roy rode his luck, flicking one to backward square where Imran Tahir failed to hang on and then edging Richardson onto the stumps so that the bails lit up - yet stubbornly refused to fall.</p>
        <p>But Roy (21 from 19) was unable to take full advantage, hooking Henry Brookes down the throat of deep square leg and the Invincibles appeared to be floundering, although Cox (32 from 29) and Sam Curran (30 from 20) kept their hopes alive.</p>
        <p>Richardson's yorker dismissed Cox and Billings was lbw first ball, but Tom Curran smashed 30 from just 12 deliveries before Helm had him caught on the boundary as Phoenix closed out the game.</p>`,

        content:`<p>Sam Northeast and Billy Root re-wrote the record books as Glamorgan defeated Worcestershire Rapids by 19 runs at New Road but Glamorgan, the holders, just failed to reach the knockout stages.</p>
        <p>Kent's last-over two wicket victory over Lancashire at Canterbury meant they advanced to the quarter-finals at Glamorgan's expense. Northeast hit his own and Glamorgan's List A best score of 177 not out from 148 balls with four sixes and 22 fours while Root equalled his best in this format by making 113 not out from 92 balls with seven sixes and six fours.</p>
        <p>The pair plundered an unbroken 245 from just 28 overs as Glamorgan amassed 356-3 from 50 overs after being put into bat. It was Glamorgan's record fourth wicket partnership in List A cricket, surpassing the 234 by Root and Chris Cooke against Gloucestershire at Bristol three years ago.</p>
        <p>The pair plundered an unbroken 245 from just 28 overs as Glamorgan amassed 356-3 from 50 overs after being put into bat. It was Glamorgan's record fourth wicket partnership in List A cricket, surpassing the 234 by Root and Chris Cooke against Gloucestershire at Bristol three years ago.</p>
        <p>Worcestershire were powerless to halt the flood of runs and Root struck five sixes in the penultimate over from Dillon Pennington, the third of which brought up his century.</p>
        <p>They made a brave reply with captain Jake Libby, Joe Leach and Ben Cox all hitting half centuries but were always struggling to reach the required rate and closed on 337 for nine, their sixth defeat in eight games.</p>
        <p>The home side handed a senior debut to Scotland international spinner, Olly Davidson, the third member of their 2021-2022 Academy intake to be bloodied in the competition after Henry Cullen and Reeve Evitts.</p>
        <p>Glamorgan were without Colin Ingram who has linked up with Guyana Amazon Warriors in the Caribbean Premier League and he was replaced by Sam Northeast.</p>
        <p>Rapids captain, Jake Libby, put Glamorgan into bat on a used hybrid pitch under cloudy skies and Joe Leach made two early breakthroughs. Tom Bevan had a let off on four when he was dropped at first slip off Dillon Pennington but it was not a costly miss for the home side.</p>
        <p>The opener added only six more before he played a loose shot off the back foot and was caught behind off Leach.</p>
        <p>It became 16 for two when Glamorgan keeper batter, Chris Cooke, pushed forward and was bowled by a delivery which nipped away. Leach and Pennington posed plenty of problems with the new ball and conceded only 27 runs in the initial powerplay.</p>
        <p>But Kiran Carlson and Northeast upped the tempo as the pressure was eased from the bowlers and the next 10 overs yielded 71 runs.</p>
        <p>Carlson collected two boundaries in the first over from Josh Tongue, continuing his comeback from a shoulder problem, and Northeast also scored freely in completing a 68 ball half century.</p>
        <p>The third wicket stand was worth 95 in 15 overs when Carlson on 41 nibbled at an Ed Barnard delivery and gave Cox his second catch. It was a deserved reward for Barnard who bowled his 10 overs in one spell for 39 runs.</p>
        <p>Davidson came into the attack for the first time at 119 for three and was unfortunate in his first over with Billy Root and Northeast both collecting boundaries from edges.</p>
        <p>But then Root and Northeast took complete command and reached their half centuries off 66 and 68 balls respectively before cutting loose. The final 10 overs yielded 139 runs with all of the Worcestershire bowlers coming in for severe punishment.</p>
        <p>Worcestershire quickly ran into trouble when they set off in pursuit of their mammoth target. Ed Pollock played in typically aggressive fashion, collecting five boundaries in three overs from Dan Douthwaite, but then aimed a legside blow at James Weighell and top edged a catch to third man.</p>
        <p>Weighell struck again in his next over as Taylor Cornall, who hit a List A best 97 against Essex, holed out to mid off.</p>
        <p>Libby and Gareth Roderick batted sensibly in consolidating Worcestershire's position in adding 52 off eight overs.</p>
        <p>Prem Sisodiya accounted for Roderick who was pouched at long on and then Barnard was caught and bowled by Carlson at 116-4. Libby reached a 48 ball half century but on 58 became Carlson's second victim when he drove tamely to cover.</p>
        <p>The run rate reached 10 an over but Leach played positively from the start of his innings, striking Andrew Gorvin for a straight six. He struck the ball in superb fashion similar to his match-winning knock against Kent chasing another big target in the RLC at New Road last summer</p>
        <p>Leach completed a 31 ball half century but then Northeast held onto an excellent one-handed catch at extra cover as he tried to hit Joe Cooke over the top. Cox was more circumspect in reaching 50 from 58 balls before Tongue (23) and Finch (14) were caught in the deep.</p>`,

        content:`<p>On Monday evening, members of the England men's Test squad taking part in the ongoing series with South Africa - and a handful of others - filed into the Ham Yard Hotel in central London for the premiere of Ben Stokes: Phoenix From The Ashes.</p>
        <p>On the face of it, there's nothing particularly unusual there. The perks of being an English Test cricketer is being invited to these VIP events, and any distraction from the innings-and-12-run defeat to the Proteas in the opener at Lord's is more than welcome. And attendance to show support for a team-mate's endeavour, particularly one so raw and confronting about a world they know all too well, is a given for a group who have grown close after starting the season with four emphatic wins.</p>
        <p>However, as England trained on Tuesday afternoon at Emirates Old Trafford, ahead of the second Test, which begins on Thursday, there was an unshakeable sense the players knew their talismanic captain a lot better. Maybe not with regards to persona or humour, or wonts and desires. But of why he is who he is, how he has come to be who he is. And, fundamentally, how the fact he is their leader and one of the best cricketers this county has produced is as much because of and despite circumstance.</p>
        <p>Players left the theatre struck by being presented with the red-eyes and cold trauma of a man coach Brendon McCullum jokes is often regarded by those around him as "bionic". Some of those present who contributed to the film as a talking head knew the framing of the movie but were still affected by seeing a mate come forward about their anxieties on the big screen. Conversations in private brought into the brightest lights.</p>
        <p>One of those was Joe Root, a close personal friend, who has had first-hand experience of much of what Stokes discusses. Root had not seen anything but the trailer until Monday night, and admitted to trepidation when he walked into the theatre because he feared he would have played the same old notes in his contribution: "Classic, 'I love batting; I love Ben again' from me."</p>
        <p>Despite his humility, there is a lot more from the former captain than that. And of all the reviews published so far, perhaps the most important ahead of Friday's release comes from Root. He believes absolutely that the film will have enhanced Stokes' status amongst the group and thus inspire a dressing room to come good for him.</p>
        <p>"I think it's very powerful what he's done, to be honest," Root said. "To share his journey and his story and everything that he's had to go through. Not just with us as team but the rest of the world. I think it's quite a powerful thing and, you know, I can't see how it won't better the environment that we're playing in. And it takes great courage and shows great leadership actually, that it's okay to not be okay sometimes, and to ask for help and go and do what he's done. So it can only be a good thing.</p>
        <p>"When you see everything that he's dealt with and put it all together and think that's only in a four- or five-year period - wow. You can forget that. Everything that's engulfed that period of time and weighed upon him throughout that journey, and I think it's quite remarkable actually that he is where he is now having been through all that."</p>
        <p>Root admitted there were topics even he wasn't aware of. Though he expected there would be some stuff Stokes kept to himself, even if the pair are thick as thieves. "You know Ben - he has not always found it easy to tell everyone where he's at, how he's feeling," Root said.</p>
        <p>It will be fascinating to see how Root is with Stokes going forward in a professional capacity. So far he has focused on scoring runs, with 583 at 83.28 and three centuries across five Tests this summer, though a blip of 8 and 6 at Lord's coincided with the first defeat under Stokes and new head coach Brendon McCullum. It was put to Root that over the last two years, if he does not make one fifty in the Test, England lose. Typically, he lays that on himself: "Well, it's your job, to score runs, as a batter. It's something you pride yourself on, you want to contribute to wins. That's part and parcel of it. The better you get the more expectation there is."</p>
        <p>But after watching the documentary, he might wonder how captaincy may exacerbate some of the issues Stokes has raised. Because no one knows better than Root just how the role can grind you down. The troughs across his five years in charge were such that acknowledgement of his undoubted quality as one of the best batters - if not the best Test batter - this country has produced was dwarfed by criticism of his captaincy.</p>
        <p>By the end, the barbs and pressure, particularly off the back of a second demoralising Ashes defeat and then a loss in the Caribbean, had started to rob him and loved ones of his true self. "I had loved leading my country," he said in his exit statement. "But recently it's hit home how much of a toll it has taken on me and the impact it has had on me away from the game."</p>
        <p>No one will be more aware of those signs than Root. And it might be that while Stokes takes it upon himself to captain by sympathy to his players and encourage them to show their best selves while at times sacrificing himself, the former skipper must bring the empathy to ensure his friend has all the necessary support in one of the most challenging jobs.</p>
        <p>"I think it's just a great example to everyone that regardless of what may be perceived on the outside everyone has those vulnerabilities and can get themselves into a very difficult place. To come from there you do need help and support from others. It's a great wake-up call. You've got to make sure the guys around you [are okay] and do what you can to reach out when the time's right or if you see something.</p>
        <p>"I love batting and I love Ben. I've said it enough times! I want to try to help us win as many games as possible and score as many runs as I can. It's very easy for me. I don't play cricket to be the best captain or score the most runs, I play to win games and enjoy that with the lads I play with."</p>

        content:`<p>A thrilling finish at Canterbury saw the Kent Spitfires qualify for the Royal London Cup play-offs with a two-wicket win over Lancashire, in Darren Stevens' white-ball swansong at the Spitfire Ground.</p>
        <p>Kent were in deep trouble on 190 for six, but Harry Podmore hit Luke Wells' penultimate ball for four to send Kent through to the knock-out stages, after a day of raw, unfiltered tension.</p>
        <p>Stevens hit 49 in his final List A innings at the St. Lawrence, but he was nearly upstaged by Lancashire's George Balderson, who played a high-risk innings and was rewarded with an unbeaten 106 from 87 balls. Josh Bohannon was the visitors' next highest-scorer with 75 as Lancashire recovered from 95 for five to post 295-9. Nathan Gilchrist claimed three for 52 and Harry Podmore three for 53.</p>
        <p>Alex Blake was Kent's top scorer with 81 and his century stand with Stevens kept the Spitfires in contention before Podmore finished the job, with Kent closing on 298 for eight.</p>
        <p>Stevens, who is still hoping to prolong his career, but who has been waylaid this season by shoulder and calf injuries at the age of 46, said: "It's sad times, it's my last white-ball game at Kent, but it's good to be out there. It's just a shame I didn't go on and win the game like I wanted to."</p>
        <p>Kent now have a play-offs tie against Leicestershire - the county were it all began for him 26 years ago. "You couldn't have written it could you? It's a different challenge, a different place to play. We haven't played white ball cricket there for a long time. We'll do our work over the next couple of days to figure out how we're going to play it."</p>
        <p>The hosts needed to win to stand any chance of reaching the quarter-finals, while hoping Yorkshire lost to Hampshire. Lancashire, having already qualified, were trying to overhaul Hampshire at the top of the Group B table.</p>
        <p>Kent chose to field first and Grant Stewart made an early breakthrough when he had Luke Wells caught behind for a duck in the third over. Gilchrist then bowled Keaton Jennings for 17 and had Steven Croft lbw for nought, but Bohannon and Dane Vilas put on 51 for the next wicket before Podmore removed the latter for 22 after a brilliant diving catch by Hamid Qadri at square leg.</p>
        <p>When Rob Jones charged at Qadri he was stumped by Ollie Robinson for nine, but Bohannon and Balderson rebuilt the innings as conditions improved.</p>
        <p>Their stand of 101 was ended when Bohannon skied Qadri to Gilchrist but George Lavelle maintained the momentum with 24 from 13 balls before he spooned Podmore to Alex Blake.</p>
        <p>Podmore then removed Danny Lamb, caught behind for eight, but Balderson reached three figures when he hooked Stewart for four in the penultimate over.</p>
        <p>Although Gilchrist subsequently bowled Tom Bailey for nine it was still Lancashire's highest List A score against Kent and when Jack Blatherwick took two wickets in three balls the target looked a long way off.</p>
        <p>Ben Compton went for three in the third over of the chase when Lamb took a juggling catch at first slip off and Ollie Robinson lasted just two balls before Blatherwick had him caught behind for a duck.</p>
        <p>Joe Denly produced a couple of elegant fours but was lbw to Bailey for 13, before the same bowler had Joey Evison caught and bowled for 20. At 53 for four the stage was set for Stevens and with Alex Blake he hauled Kent back into contention as they put on 105 for the next wicket.</p>
        <p>Back in the year 2000 Stevens had played for Leicestershire against a Kent side that included Wells' father Alan and he hit successive Wells Junior deliveries for six before falling just short of his half-century, caught and bowled by Croft. He departed to a standing ovation and kissed his helmet before entering the pavilion.</p>
        <p>Blake then chipped Wells to Jennings, but Harry Finch and Grant Stewart hit back with a 73-run partnership.</p>
        <p>When Stewart hit Balderson for successive sixes Kent looked favourites, but he fell for 49, caught by Croft off Blatherwick, just as news filtered through that Yorkshire had lost.</p>
        <p>Podmore joined Finch and whittled away at the target, with every run cheered by the crowd of 2,101, to leave Kent needing three from the final over, but Finch hit Wells first delivery to Vilas.</p>
        <p>The next two were dots and Wells missed a difficult return catch as Qadri scrambled a single from the fourth, leaving Podmore to drive the winning boundary through the covers. Kent now have a quarter-final trip to Stevens' home county Leicestershire.</p>`,

        content:`<p>Luis Reece scored his second century of this year's Royal London Cup campaign to set up a Derbyshire victory by eight wickets against Northamptonshire on a day of records and big runs at Wantage Road.</p>
        <p>It was Derbyshire's highest successful run chase in all List A cricket, beating their previous best of 309, also against Northamptonshire, in 2017.</p>
        <p>Reece (106) shared a mammoth opening partnership worth 204 with his captain Billy Godleman (87) as Derbyshire chased down 312 to win. It was a record stand in List A games between these two sides and the highest for any Derbyshire wicket beating the previous best between Kim Barnett and Chris Adams in 1997.</p>
        <p>When both fell, Derbyshire were behind the run rate but Shan Masood (53) and Harry Came (44) kept up the pace, making short work of the remaining runs in a blaze of boundaries with seven balls to spare.</p>
        <p>That meant subdued celebrations for Lewis McManus, who had hit his maiden List A century (107 off 111 balls). The keeper shared a stand of 161 with Tom Taylor (75 off 54 balls) who also hit his highest score in all formats in Northamptonshire colours.</p>
        <p>Statisticians could take delight at least. It was the biggest Northamptonshire List A partnership for any wicket against Derbyshire, beating the previous best of 158 between David Sales and Alex Wakely in 2012. It was also the highest fifth-wicket partnership in List A cricket for Northamptonshire against any opposition, beating the previous record set by Allan Lamb and David Capel.</p>
        <p>Derbyshire made an immediate breakthrough when Ben Aitchison struck in consecutive overs to remove the dangerous pair of Ricardo Vasconcelos, who was caught off a top edge, and skipper Will Young who edged to the keeper.</p>
        <p>Saif Zaib and Emilio Gay led the recovery, putting on 58 in 10 overs, with Zaib stroking boundaries off three consecutive deliveries from Sam Conners before Gay (29) chipped Reece straight to short midwicket.</p>
        <p>After putting on 59 with McManus, Zaib (62) reverse swept Mattie McKiernan straight to Mark Watt behind square. It was to be the last wicket for some time as Taylor joined forces with McManus.</p>
        <p>McManus' first 50 included just three boundaries but he ran sharply between the wickets and reached the milestone off 79 deliveries. From there he accelerated with the rest of his runs coming off just 32 balls. He hit Watt straight down the ground for six and hooked Nick Potts and Conners behind square for two further maximums. Conners went the distance again when McManus struck him high over deep midwicket and smashed him down the pitch.</p>
        <p>Taylor smote Watt over long-on for six but was content to let McManus have the strike initially. He took a liking to Potts though, playing a stinging drive through the covers and whipping him through midwicket. He crunched Connors down the ground for four and scooped him over the keeper to bring up his fifth List A half-century. The carnage continued when he swung Reece high over long-on into the stands for six.</p>
        <p>The pair were finally parted when McManus was run out while Taylor fell when he missed an attempted scoop and was bowled by Conners.</p>
        <p>Derbyshire got off to a bright start in the chase. Reece soon found the boundary, playing a brace of perfect on-drives down the pitch off Taylor, scooping him for another boundary and whipping Nathan Buck over backward square leg for six. He advanced to his half-century off exactly 50 deliveries with his eighth boundary.</p>
        <p>Godleman too was timing the ball beautifully through the covers and reached his half-century by pulling Buck aggressively for four.</p>
        <p>The Falcons otherwise breezed past 150 without loss in the 26th over with neither batter looking troubled or needing to take many risks, most of the boundaries coming along the floor rather than through the air. Northamptonshire's largely inexperienced attack seldom looked threatening after almost drawing the edge in the opening overs. Wickets looked most likely to come through spin with Zaib having three lbw appeals turned down in two overs.</p>
        <p>Derbyshire passed 200 in the 35th over but when Reece attempted to force the pace, coming down the pitch to Taylor, he could only pick out Gay who took an excellent tumbling legside boundary catch. He had faced 120 balls and hit 13 fours and one six.</p>
        <p>Four overs later Godleman (99 balls) departed too, run out thanks to some sharp work by Sales with Derbyshire still needing 91 with nine overs to go.</p>
        <p>Shan Masood held the key to Derbyshire's hopes and he came out determined to play his shots, whipping a legside half volley from Sales off his pads for six, supported by Came who struck two big sixes as the pair added 50 in five overs to leave Derbyshire needing 36 off the last five.</p>`

        content:`<p>Contrasting half-centuries from Rishi Patel and Arron Lilley saw Leicestershire complete a nervy victory over Durham and qualify for the knock-out stages of the Royal London One Day Cup.</p>
        <p>It had looked as though it was going to be a far more comfortable win for the Foxes when they reduced the visitors to 54 for 7 after winning the toss and bowling first, but brave and intelligent batting from a young lower order saw Durham post 197 before 18-year-old Stanley McAlindon, who had earlier scored his maiden half-century, picked up four wickets and the veteran Chris Rushworth three to reduce the Foxes to 158 for 8.</p>
        <p>It needed an unbeaten ninth wicket partnership of 30 between bowlers Beuran Hendricks and Eddie Barnes to see Leicestershire home, the two points securing second place in Group A and a home play-off for the semi-finals on Friday.</p>
        <p>Put into bat on a hybrid pitch being used for the second time in four days, Durham were quickly in trouble. Graham Clark, scorer of a half century in each of his two previous innings, looked to cut a delivery from Chris Wright, but steered the ball low towards backward point, where Patel dived forward to take a smart low catch. Jonathan Bushnell was also caught by Patel, this time a rather more comfortable chance given off the leading edge, but Sean Dickson may have been unfortunate to be given out leg before to a Wiaan Mulder delivery which cut back and may have been missing leg stump.</p>
        <p>There were no question marks over the dismissal of Liam Trevaskis, bowled by a Wright delivery that swung back into him, before former Australia international Nick Maddinson, having battled his way to 20, limply hung out his bat at Hendricks and feathered a catch behind to wicket-keeper Harry Swindells.</p>
        <p>The next delivery saw the end of Tom Mackintosh, again somewhat unlucky to be given out off a Hendricks lifter that appeared to come off his shoulder rather than his bat before looping gently to Patel, and when acting captain Paul Coughlin drove airily at a Mulder out-swinger and edged to Swindells, Durham were 54 for 7 in just the 20th over.</p>
        <p>It was down to the young tail to drag them towards any sort of score, and this they did admirably. Seventeen-year-old Mitchell Killeen, son of former Durham stalwart Neil, led the way, hitting 32 off 52 balls and putting together a half-century partnership with George Drissell before going back to pull a delivery from occasional off-spinner Louis Kimber that stayed low, sliding underneath his bat and hitting him in front of all three stumps.</p>
        <p>Drissell, having gone to 30, holed out to long off, but not before putting on another 44 for the ninth wicket with McAlindon, and McAlindon himself then reached a maiden half-century, the highlight consecutive sixes off Scott Steel, before being caught and bowled in the final over of the innings. The final three wickets of the innings realised 143 runs.</p>
        <p>Leicestershire made the worst possible start in their chase, Rushworth pinning Nick Welch leg before with his first delivery. Steel, making his first appearance of the season in the competition, was then bowled by Rushworth off a thick inside edge, and when the in-form Louis Kimber spooned a simple catch to mid-on, the home crowd's silence was deafening. Captain Lewis Hill came and went quickly, cutting at a wide one from McAlindon and giving a simple catch behind, and soon afterwards Mulder, who has to some extent carried Leicestershire's batting in the competition, was well caught by Maddinson high to his left as he failed to get over a cut at McAlindon.</p>
        <p>Swindells, back on his stumps, was plumb leg before two balls later, but Patel, who had come in first wicket down, batted with real responsibility, and with Lilley riding his luck massively, put together a partnership of 98 for the seventh wicket. They were helped by some curious decisions by Coughlin, most notably that to give an over to occasional left-armer Maddinson - that solitary over cost 15 runs, and handed the initiative to the home team.</p>
        <p>Both Patel and Lilley went on the same score, Patel caught at mid-on and Lilley behind the wicket, but Hendricks and Barnes held their nerve to see the Foxes home.</p>`

        content:`<p>Somerset collected their first Royal London Cup win at the eighth and last attempt and dragged Warwickshire out of the competition in the process with a 14-run victory at Edgbaston.</p>
        <p>Lewis Goldsworthy's maiden List A century (111, 116 balls) and Jack Brooks' excellent bowling (four for 38) underpinned a win which brought some belated light to a leaden campaign.</p>
        <p>Somerset owed their total to a third-wicket stand of 198 in 35 overs between Goldsworthy and James Rew (96, 120). Olly Hannon-Dalby and Liam Norwell took two wickets apiece but George Garrett impressed most, conceding 37 from his ten overs.</p>
        <p>Warwickshire knew that reaching 267 would take them through to the knockout phase but their depleted batting order, without the injured Krunal Pandya and Michael Burgess, fell just short on 252 all out. Captain Will Rhodes (92, 103) and Ethan Brookes (51, 57) added 104 in 18 overs for the fifth wicket but there were no contributions of substance either side of their stand.</p>
        <p>After choosing to bat, Somerset soon lost former Warwickshire opener Andy Umeed, bowled by Norwell who also had Steven Davies superbly caught low at slip by Rob Yates. With three vital championship games to come in September, the Bears will be encouraged to see Norwell starting to regain full fitness and menace.</p>
        <p>Rew and Goldsworthy rebuilt, slowly at first, then more fluently, reaching their half-centuries from 77 and 71 balls respectively. The latter struck 12 fours in a polished innings before falling lbw to Yates.</p>
        <p>Eighteen-year-old Rew was a boundary short of his second List A ton when he sliced Hannon-Dalby to short third man. George Bartlett's tidy unbeaten 29 (21 balls) lifted Somerset to a competitive score.</p>
        <p>Yates (four fours and a six in 25) gave Warwickshire's reply a brisk start until he was brilliantly caught at extra cover by Bartlett off Kasey Aldridge. A string of batters then also picked out fielders. Bartlett pounced again at extra when Dom Sibley (23, 36 balls) lifted a drive at Brooks and Goldsworthy added wickets to his earlier runs as Hamza Shaikh swept to deep mid-wicket and Matt Lamb cut to point.</p>
        <p>That was 95 for four but as Rhodes and Brookes' enterprising batting righted the ship and got the crowd involved. Brookes twice located the Hollies Stand on his way to a 53-ball half-century before edging Brooks to wicketkeeper Davies.</p>
        <p>Brooks' then pinned Kai Smith lbw with a yorker to send Warwickshire into the last five overs needing another 42. Denied the required boundaries by disciplined, full-length bowling, they entered the final over requiring 21. That was well beyond the tail and they accompany their opponents out of the tournament.</p>`

        content:`<p>Aneurin Donald's blistering, career-best 76 set in-form Hampshire up for a resounding Royal London Cup victory against Yorkshire at Scarborough, ensuring a home semi-final next Tuesday as a result.</p>
        <p>Group B winners Hampshire's 16th win in 17 games across all competitions - they comfortably defended a 314 target to win by 72 runs - also left the Vikings sweating on their own qualification hopes.</p>
        <p>Yorkshire knew a final day win would have secured third place in the table and an away eliminator clash on Friday. But defeat opened the door for Kent to bear them to a play-offs place.</p>
        <p>Donald clattered five sixes in a 31-ball innings which was the feature of the Hawks' 313 for nine having been inserted, while opener Ben Brown made 60 and Tom Prest 55.</p>
        <p>Matthew Revis claimed his own career-best four for 77 from nine overs before adding 41 as Yorkshire attempted to recover from 31 for four in reply before being bowled out for a respectable 241 inside 46 overs. New-ball seamer John Turner impressed with five for 41 from 8.3.</p>
        <p>Hampshire lost Nick Gubbins for 38, lbw sweeping at the off-spin of Dom Bess, as their score fell to 87 for one in the 19th over on a pitch which nibbled early on.</p>
        <p>Brown scored the bulk of his runs behind square on both sides of the wicket. Prest slog-swept Bess over midwicket for his first six and drove Revis on the up over cover for his second. The latter came two balls before Brown drove the same bowler to cover, leaving the score at 150 for two in the 33rd. But that only paved the way for Donald's pyrotechnics.</p>
        <p>Prest was 40 when the Welshman arrived at the crease, and both men were on 52 when the latter reached his fifty off 23 balls. At one stage, he hit four sixes in as many balls, three off Jack Shutt's off-spin. He pummelled the leg-side boundary and scattered spectators in a 3,500 crowd.</p>
        <p>Yorkshire sought to limit the onslaught. Firstly, they removed Prest and Donald with successive balls at the end of the 41st over and the start of the 42nd - 243 for four. Prest was superbly caught at long-off by a diving Will Luxton, who was on as substitute fielder, off Bess before Donald picked out cover against Matthew Waite.</p>
        <p>Revis then added another three wickets as Hampshire lower order succumbed against a host of miscues, the visitors losing seven wickets for 76 in the last 10 overs.</p>
        <p>Revis had Fletcha Middleton caught and bowled, Toby Albert caught at cover and Turner caught at backward point.</p>
        <p>However, Yorkshire's top order was obliterated inside eight overs amidst significant new ball movement through the air and off the pitch.</p>
        <p>Turner jagged one back in at Will Fraine and bowled him before getting a squared-up Fin Bean caught behind. Either side of those wickets, Ian Holland forced Harry Duke into a miscued pull to wide mid-on and bowled George Hill through the gate with an inswinger, leaving the hosts 31 for four after 7.1 overs.</p>
        <p>A 55-run stand between Jonny Tattersall and Waite, 25 and 28, gave Yorkshire brief respite. But they fell caught at midwicket and behind inside three overs to seamers John Campbell and Scott Currie - 106 for six in the 17th.</p>
        <p>Revis and Bess (27) then shared 64 for the seventh wicket as Yorkshire battled back again. However, the latter was forced to retire hurt having been struck on the back of the head by a wild throw from Middleton at cover as he tried to complete a quick single.</p>
        <p>That came at 170 for six after 32, bringing Harry Sullivan into the game as concussion sub. Revis was caught at point by Middleton off Currie shortly afterwards before Ben Coad (24) handed Turner his third wicket at 228 for six after 42.</p>
        <p>He bowled Sullivan for wicket number four before the game was wrapped up when Shutt top-edged him behind. Loten finished unbeaten with a consolatory 43, Yorkshire's top score.</p>`

        content:`<p>Reece Topley has pulled out of the final two weeks of the Hundred in order to ensure he is fit to play in the T20 World Cup.</p>
        <p>Topley was England's standout bowler in white-ball cricket this summer, taking 17 wickets across 10 limited-overs appearances against India and South Africa, and said in a statement that he had been "feeling the effects of a busy summer more and more over the last few weeks".</p>
        <p>"Taking a short break feels like a sensible precaution to avoid injury and the risk of a longer lay-off," he said in a statement released by his Hundred team, Oval Invincibles. "Nonetheless, I'm disappointed not to be contributing as the team enters a crucial period in the competition."</p>
        <p>Tom Moody, Invincibles' head coach, said he was "obviously disappointed to be losing a player of Reece's calibre" but that the team "respect[s] his decision". Invincibles are expected to sign a replacement player in the coming days.</p>
        <p>Topley took five wickets - three of them in a crucial opening burst against Southern Brave - in his four appearances in the Hundred this season but his departure is a major blow to Invincibles' chances of play-off qualification.</p>
        <p>He previously missed their win against Welsh Fire in order to manage his body, and told ESPNcricinfo that he was "having to box smart" ahead of the World Cup. "Obviously there's a lot of chat about the schedule and to be honest, for me to play as much as I have this summer and try to get to October fully fit probably isn't sustainable," he said.</p>
        <p>"I'm having to box smart with where I play and not necessarily go for broke at this point in the season. My priority is to be available for selection for the World Cup and I'm doing everything in my power to be available. If that means missing games here and there, so be it."</p>
        <p>Invincibles will also lose two overseas players after Tuesday night's game against Birmingham Phoenix: Sunil Narine will return to the Caribbean to play in the CPL, while Mohammad Hasnain has been called up to Pakistan's Asia Cup squad. Peter Hatzoglou, the Australian spinner, will replace Narine, with Hasnain's replacement unconfirmed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Jos Buttler has revealed he is not certain to play all seven of England's T20 internationals in Pakistan next month after being ruled out of the rest of the Hundred with a calf strain. "Whether I'll be available for all those games, I'm not quite sure yet," he said while working for Sky Sports as a pundit.</p>

        content:`<p>Oval Invincibles squeezed the life out of Birmingham Phoenix's star-studded batting line-up with spin, boosting their qualification hopes and leaving Southern Brave as the only unbeaten side across the women's Hundred.</p>
        <p>Alice Capsey, Sophia Smale and Mady Villiers returned combined figures of 5 for 48 from 50 balls, running through Phoenix's top order while suffocating their scoring, to leave Invincibles needing only 107 to win in their third and final home game.</p>
        <p>They knocked the target off with 13 balls to spare, as Lauren Winfield-Hill anchored the run chase with 41 not out off 38 balls. Emily Arlott bowled tightly, taking 1 for 8 from 17 balls and dismissing Capsey, but Phoenix needed regular wickets and struggled to make inroads.</p>
        <h5>van Niekerk returns</h5>
        <p> Invincibles' decision to leave Dane van Niekerk out of their last two games was a seismic one: she was their captain and the tournament's MVP as they lifted the trophy last season, but with four overseas players permitted in the squad and Suzie Bates in excellent form, she was squeezed out of the side.</p>
        <p>But with her wife Marizanne Kapp rested for the Phoenix game with a sore quadriceps, van Niekerk returned to the side. "It has been tough sitting out," she admitted at the toss, resuming captaincy duties after Bates had been deputised, as her decision to bowl first was vindicated by an impressive performance from her bowlers.</p>
        <p>With the bat, she was not at her fluent best but still made a telling contribution from No. 4 in what was her first innings since last year's WBBL final. Van Niekerk was reprieved early on when Amy Jones fumbled a run-out chance, but consecutive boundaries - one swept, one pulled - off Georgia Elwiss removed any scoring pressure from the chase.</p>
        <p>She ended up unbeaten on 21 off as many balls, leaving Invincibles' coach Jon Batty with another tough decision to make when Kapp returns to fitness.</p>
        <h5>Phoenix flounder</h5>
        <p> Phoenix came into this game with a 100% record to protect but never got going with the bat. Sophie Devine fell early, top-edging a sweep into the leg side to be caught-and-bowled by Smale - the 17-year-old left-arm spinner - as Eve Jones' anchoring, run-a-ball 29 was the only contribution of note.</p>
        <p>Smale, Capsey and Villiers removed all of the top five between them. Capsey had Amy Jones caught slapping to point, while Villiers' arm ball accounted for Ellyse Perry, who was smartly stumped by Winfield-Hill. Capsey bowled Eve Jones and Sophie Molineux as Phoenix slipped from 64 for 2 to 71 for 5, and they could only sneak up to 106 despite Emily Arlott's late blows.</p>
        <h5>Invincibles cruise home</h5>
        <p> Winfield-Hill and Bates set the tone in the chase with three boundaries in the first seven balls, getting Invincibles ahead of the run rate. And despite Bates falling inside the powerplay, Capsey signalled her intent by hammering her third ball down the ground for six. When Winfield-Hill hit Molineux for four and six in the first set of the powerplay, the rest of the innings was a formality.</p>
        <p>"It was a big game for us," Capsey said. "Everyone came out with the energy of wanting to be part of a big occasion. I tend to thrive on the big moments; it narrows my focus a bit more. At the moment, within this team, I'm really backed to take the positive option which is amazing. It gives me great confidence."</p>

        content:`<p>Sussex secured a home semi-final in the Royal London One-Day Cup after their rampant batsmen made 400 for four against Middlesex at Hove, hitting 249 from their last 20 overs.</p>
        <p>They were led by an unbeaten 189 not out by Tom Alsop, his best List A score, while captain Cheteshwar Pujara continued his spectacular form with 132, the pair adding 240 for the third wicket in 27 overs as Sussex topped Group A with six wins in eight matches. With results going against them elsewhere, Middlesex were knocked out of the competition.</p>
        <p>The Sussex total was their highest score in one-day cricket, beating their 399 in a 40-over game in Horsham. They scored 397 for five against Somerset at Taunton on Friday.</p>
        <p>Long before they were finished, they had passed their previous one-day best against Middlesex, 333 for four at Hove last year. It was also the highest one-day score against Middlesex, beating Nottinghamshire's 368 for two at Lord's in the same competition in 2014.</p>
        <p>That left Middlesex needing to beat their previous best chase (292 for four against Surrey at Lord's in 2014) by a big margin. Essentially, Middlesex were required to play Twenty20 cricket for 50 overs. And, with their deep batting, they kept coming at the Sussex bowlers even as the wickets tumbled. Joe Cracknell led the way with a 73-ball 71, with ten fours and there were plenty of bright cameos but the task was overwhelming and they were bowled out for 243 in 38.1 overs.</p>
        <p>When Sussex started their innings, they looked unlikely to scale the heights. Invited to bat in damp conditions, under floodlights and heavy clouds, they must have suspected the odds were against them, even though the depleted Middlesex attack was missing the injured Umesh Yadav, Toby Greatwood and Ethan Bamber.</p>
        <p>Alsop, back from a back spasm and replacing Dan Ibrahim, and Ali Orr, in subdued form after his double century at Taunton, looked sedate rather than commanding as they took 58 runs off the opening ten overs.</p>
        <p>Orr fell for 20 off 28 deliveries, caught behind as he played a diffident stroke against the impressive Thilan Walallawita, and it was 95 for two in the 18th over when Tom Clark chopped on a wide one from Max Harris.</p>
        <p>Alsop and Pujara then put on 240 for the third wicket in 27 overs. Pujara started methodically, as he always does, and reached his half-century from 49 deliveries; he then doubled his strike rate, scoring 82 more from another 41, finishing with 20 fours and two sixes in his third century in the competition.</p>
        <p>After 32 overs Sussex were 160 for two, scoring at exactly five an over. They added 240 runs in their final 18 overs. The spinners Walallawita and Luke Hollman - early on - put a brake on the Sussex scoring. But Middlesex's success with their slower bowlers ended when Stoneman's three overs went for 33 and both Alsop and Pujara got after Martin Andersson, who conceded 110 in his nine overs, and Harris, who went from 90 in ten.</p>`

        content:`<p>Notts Outlaws finished their Royal London Cup campaign with back-to-back wins to clinch a place in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>After last Saturday's thumping victory over Leicestershire, the Outlaws registered another emphatic success, defeating Surrey by eight wickets at Welbeck.</p>
        <p>Ben Slater (81 not out) and Lyndon James (54) helped them chase down a target of 182 with more than 18 overs to spare at the north Nottinghamshire venue, which improved their net run rate to the extent that they finished ahead of Middlesex and Gloucestershire to claim third place in Group A on 10 points, behind Sussex and Leicestershire, who each have 12 points.</p>
        <p>Both Middlesex and Warwickshire could have edged the Outlaws out of the qualifying places, but Middlesex lost by 157 runs to Sussex and Warwickshire were beaten by Somerset.</p>
        <p>Notts now meet Lancashire away in the quarter-finals on Friday.</p>
        <p>Surrey had been bowled out for 181 in 39.2 overs, seamer Toby Pettman finishing with four for 44 in only his second senior appearance for Nottinghamshire. It could have been worse for the visitors, who had been 36 for five.</p>
        <p>Tom Lawes, the 19-year-old all-rounder, countered with a List A career-best 75 off 63 balls after being dropped on seven, but Brett Hutton followed up his seven for 26 against Leicestershire with three for 24. The other three wickets were shared between left-arm spinners Liam Patterson-White and Fateh Singh.</p>
        <p>On a green-tinged pitch and with cloud cover at the start, Pettman and Hutton more than justified skipper Haseeb Hameed's decision to bowl first as Surrey, one of only three teams in Group A who were completely out of contention, emerged from the opening powerplay in trouble at 31 for four.</p>
        <p>Pettman struck first as Surrey captain Ben Geddes edged to first slip, following up his first wicket for Nottinghamshire with a second, as more away movement accounted for Cameron Steel, caught at second slip.</p>
        <p>At 24, the right-armer, who joined the county after leaving Oxford University with a double first in classics, is not short of experience, having made 10 first-class appearances and taken 42 wickets, although none yet for Nottinghamshire.</p>
        <p>Pettman then held a simple catch at third man as Hutton weighed in by dismissing Ryan Patel via a top edge before having John Blake caught behind. Hutton had 18-year-old Sheridon Gumbs caught behind in his next over, pushing forward in much the same way as Blake to a ball that found a thin edge.</p>
        <p>Lawes had his notable life when Hameed put down a straightforward chance at mid-on off Dane Paterson and survived a half-chance on 12 when his drive in the air brushed the fingertips of the South African pace bowler on the way to the boundary.</p>
        <p>He made the Outlaws pay, adding 55 for the sixth wicket with Nico Reifer, who fell to a sharp return catch taken by Patterson-White, and 77 for the seventh with Nick Kimber, before following a couple of meaty blows off Pettman that brought him six and four with a miscue to backward point.</p>
        <p>Kimber was bowled by Singh as he went to cut and the last four Surrey wickets fell for 13, Pettman picking up his fourth when Matt Dunn hit straight to mid-off.</p>
        <p>Sol Budinger, who turned 23 on Sunday, launched the Outlaws chase in typical rumbustious style, smashing 32 off 20 balls, half of those runs accrued in three blows as he went four-six-dot-six off Lawes before perishing to a smart, low catch at mid-on in the same over.</p>
        <p>At 68 for one off 10, the Outlaws were well ahead of the required rate and Slater and James, the former's punchy style contrasting with the latter's elegance, seldom looked troubled in adding 114 in 23 overs before the latter picked out the fielder at deep backward square.</p>
        <p>Slater, who boasts a remarkable List A average of 55.64 in 52 matches, reached his half-century from 61 balls with five fours and a six hoiked over backward square off Conor McKerr, adding five more boundarie, culminating in the winning one off leg-spinner Cameron Steel.</p>
        <p>Surrey's interim head coach, Gareth Batty, said: "There have been positives from the competition. It hasn't translated into too many wins, which is a disappointment, but we've brought in four academy players to register as pros and had a few good performances from senior players. Overall it is a development competition and we have developed a few players really well, including developing leadership skills in Ben Geddes, who has led very well."</p>`

        author:"Firdose Moonda",

        content:`<p>Koos Jansen spotted the cricketing talent of his twin sons, Marco and Duan, when they were nine-years-old and ran with it. Much like Richard Williams, who masterminded Venus and Serena's rise to being among the best players tennis has ever seen, Koos made it his mission to train and talk to his kids about the sport he believed they would excel in, becoming cricket's equivalent of King Richard. Let's call him King Koos.</p>
        <p>Like Williams, and in keeping with a few other famous cricketing dads, Koos Jansen wasn't always gentle in his methods.</p>
        <p>"There have been some very tough times when my dad was very tough on us," Marco Jansen, South Africa's 22-year old tearaway, said. "There was no sugarcoating. Back then, he spoke to us in the same way he is speaking to us now. Nothing has changed. That enabled us to grow and mature a bit quicker than all the other kids when we were a bit young.</p>
        <p>"Since we were growing up, he is the one that has been - not the tough guy - but harder on us, especially when it comes to sport." Koos demanded the best from his boys in other spheres too, such as academics. "But we weren't that great," Jansen said.</p>
        <p>By Jansen's own admission, and despite some eye-watering numbers (164 and 80 respectively) in a T20 game for example, the pair were not stand-out youth players either. "My high school career didn't go well. I wasn't the top schoolboy cricketer," Jansen said.</p>
        <p>Neither of he nor Duan played in an Under-19 World Cup and both made their names as net bowlers. In a professional era where the pathways are clearly laid out, and usually followed, theirs is the stuff of fairytales, which is why when Jansen made his Test debut, with only 18 first-class appearances to his name (and of those only half in South Africa's top-tier of domestic cricket), he could barely believe his good fortune. "If you had told me you will make your debut against India in South Africa, I would have laughed and said, no, there's no chance," he said.</p>
        <p>There was an element of his selection which was about him being in the right place at the right time. South Africa were without Anrich Nortje for that India series and would have picked Duanne Olivier for the Boxing Day Test but he had not fully recovered from Covid-19 and was nursing a hamstring niggle. When Jansen's name appeared on the team-sheet, it was a surprise and he found himself under scrutiny immediately.</p>
        <p>He was nervous and his first spell was wayward but he returned later in the match and showed off an ability to swing the ball at pace, to exploit any bounce and to challenge even the best. In India's second innings, Jansen dismissed Mayank Agarwal, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Mohammed Siraj to finish his debut match with five wickets.</p>
        <p>He has since added KL Rahul - three times - Cheteshwar Pujara and most recently Joe Root to his list of wickets and continues to ask serious questions of marquee players. In Root's case, Jansen struck him on the pad with a delivery that shaped in and the amount of movement on offer at Lord's surprised Jansen himself. "I didn't expect the ball to swing that much," Jansen said. "The plan was to stick around that off stump or fourth stump area and let the ball pass through there. If it nips back then it brings all dismissals into play and if it just straightens, you can nick him off. When you get the big names out, it's always a good feeling."</p>
        <p>The best, in fact. Though Jansen has an IPL deal and was among the players who opted out of the series against Bangladesh earlier in the year, he spoke of Test cricket as the highlight of becoming an international. "I enjoy the red-ball format. It's the format where what you put in, you get out. If you bowl well, you will get wickets. If you bat well, you will score runs," he said. "That's what I have enjoyed the most. And just being around the guys, they make it lekker [nice] to play the game."</p>
        <p>As the youngest in the group, Jansen is soaking up the knowledge from players who are much more experienced than him, much like he did with his dad.</p>
        <p>"Like today, we had a lekker long practice session, so then you chat to them and you ask all the nitty gritty stuff," he said of South Africa's preparations for the second Test at Old Trafford. "They help you think out of the box. And there's the coaches as well. They bring a different perspective. There's a lot of angles or perspectives you have at your disposal to try and figure out what you can do to give yourself the best chance to perform."</p>
        <p>There's also some advice about what not to do. Naturally, because of Jansen's frame - he stands at 2.06 metres tall - there are concerns about overbowling him and injuries. He has already overcome what was turning into a stress fracture of the lower back. "I've had problems when I was 18 or 19 - a semi-stress fracture in the lower back. I have grown a lot quicker for my body to adjust to my muscles and all those kinds of stuff."</p>
        <p>To try to prevent future issues, he has to work specifically on his lower body and abdominal area. "My core has to be strong. My glutes, my lower body have to be very strong because that's where most of my loads go. Because I twist a lot, if my core muscles are quite strong, then I have a base to work from."</p>
        <p>That's how Jansen's entire career has been. He has the foundations laid by his family (and he wants you to know that Koos was also always there for "a bit of love and a bit of softness") and he built on those by almost immediately joining the best cricketers in the country and turning out regularly for them. And it's not just any international team.</p>
        <p>After the last year South Africa have had in Tests, and their performance at Lord's, there's already talk this pace pack could become one of the best going around. Asked if he thought the South Africa attack was as good as it could be, Jansen checked himself. "I wouldn't say we are unbeatable. We put in the hard yards and we are still putting in the hard yards," he said. "We don't take anything for granted because we know when we do that, Mother Cricket is going to kick you on the backside."</p>
        <p>Or make that, Papa (King) Koos.</p>

        metaDesc:"Team-mate hopes his example can encourage others to seek help when they need it",
        author:"Vithushan Ehantharajah",
        image:`https://img1.hscicdn.com/image/upload/f_auto,t_ds_w_640/lsci/db/PICTURES/CMS/340400/340441.4.jpg`,
        content:`<p>Joe Root has praised the honesty of Ben Stokes for talking about his struggles with anxiety and believes the England captain's openness on the subject will continue the progress made against the stigma of mental health.</p>
        <p>Speaking in his new documentary film, "Ben Stokes: Phoenix from the Ashes", the 31-year-old has opened up about the battles endured, including a series of panic attacks stemming from a build-up of personal trauma over the previous few years. That came to a head in 2021, when Stokes took a break midway through the summer for his well-being having struggled to come to terms with his father's passing the year before, during which period he contemplated walking away from the game entirely.</p>
        <p>The allrounder was keen to talk on all matters, good and bad, without sugarcoating. As such, he ends up speaking extensively on working through his issues initially, and the constant management of his anxiety through medication and professional help.</p>
        <p>Root, who features in the film, watched it for the first at the premiere on Monday in London, along with the rest of the England squad, who then arrived in Manchester on Tuesday morning ahead of the second Test against South Africa, which begins here on Thursday.. While he admits it was a tough watch, Root envisages many who watch the film, whether into cricket or otherwise, will leave with a greater sense of the man and a reaffirmation of the importance of asking those close to you how they are.</p>
        <p>"I think it's exactly what you've come to see from Ben as a leader," Root said at Emirates Old Trafford, where England will look to square the three-match series. "How honest he is, what he expects of everyone else is stuff he would be willing to do himself. I think it shows great courage, great bravery to come out and speak openly about that stuff and some of the struggles he has personally been through. We were all there with him going through it, it's not easy to see a close friend and team-mate like that but look at him now. It's great to have him leading this team and making Test cricket so enjoyable to play and to watch.</p>
        <p>"I think with any of your mates you want to get around them, make sure you do what you can to help. That goes within the dressing room environment and away from the game as well. You just want to do what you can to help out.</p>
        <p>"It's quite powerful for people to see. Sometimes it's okay not to be okay, to ask for help is perfectly alright and a brave thing to do. For someone like Ben to do that - hopefully if there are people out there struggling or finding things difficult, they can gain the courage to ask for that help."</p>
        <p>Root also revealed he knew of the possibility Stokes was considering leaving the game. During Stokes' time away, Root was one of the few people in the England dressing room still in regular contact. As captain, he had been shorn of his right-hand man for the series against India, before being bolstered by his return for the Ashes that winter. A 4-0 defeat to Australia, then a 1-0 loss in the Caribbean was ultimately Root's lot, before Stokes took over in May.</p>
        <p>"There were discussions at different points, but they are things should be kept between the two of us," he said. "It's been very powerful watching that documentary - you forget how much he has been through in such a short space of time. It's very brave to lay himself as bare as he has done. It's very powerful for anyone watching, to see someone who at times looks superhuman and can do things that other players can't do - it shows great leadership to put yourself out there and express some of the difficulties he's had to go through."</p>
